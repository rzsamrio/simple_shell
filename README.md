# Simple Shell - Collaborative Remake of the shell
Welcome to the Simple Shell project, the shell is a huge program that took years of coding and improving to reach its current level. This is why the project is called "Simple Shell" in addition to have a 15 day period to code it as part of our ALX SE course project 0x16. C - Simple Shell

## Overview of the Shell
A shell is a command-line interface program that acts as an intermediary between the user and the operating system. It provides a way for users to interact with the system by entering commands, executing programs, and managing files and directories.

#### Some features of the shell
1. **Command Interpretation:**  interprets the commands entered by the user and translates them into instructions that the operating system can understand and execute.
2. **Program Execution:** It can run programs, scripts, and commands by invoking the appropriate system calls to execute the desired operations.

3. **Input/Output Redirection:** A shell allows you to redirect input and output streams of programs, enabling you to send output to files or read input from files instead of using the standard input and output.

4. **Pipeline Support:** Shells often allow you to chain together multiple commands using pipes (|) to pass the output of one command as the input to another.

5. **Variable Management:** Shells typically support the use of environment variables to store information that can be accessed by both the shell and the programs it runs..
